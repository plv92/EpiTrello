# EpiTrello
EpiTrello is a web-based project management application inspired by Trello and the Kanban method. It allows you to create boards containing lists of cards representing tasks. Each card can be assigned to a user, moved between lists to reflect its progress, and enriched with details such as a description, deadline, or tags.
